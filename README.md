# rtl8192eu linux drivers

**NOTE:** The `master` branch is based on Realtek's driver versioned 4.3.1.1. The branch `realtek-4.4.x` is based on 4.4.1 originally.

The official drivers for D-Link DWA-131 Rev E, with patches to keep it working on newer kernels.
Also works on Rosewill RNX-N180UBE v2 N300 Wireless Adapter.

**NOTE:** This is just a "mirror". I have no knowledge about this code or how it works. Expect no support from me or any contributors here. I just think GitHub is a nicer way of keeping track of this than random forum posts and precompiled binaries being sent by email. I don't want someone else to have to spend 5 days of googling and compiling with random patches until it works.

## Source for the official drivers

Official drivers were downloaded from D-Link Australia. D-Link USA and the european countries I checked only lists revision A and B. Australia lists all three.

## Patches

You can see the applied patches, their sources and/or motivation by looking at the commits. The `master` branch will mostly be kept clean with a single commit per patch, except for Pull Requests. You can review commit by commit and then record the SHA in order to get a safe reference to use. As long as the SHA stays the same you know that what you get has been reviewed by you.

Note that updates to this README will show up as separate commits. I will not mix changes to this file with changes to the code in case you want to mirror this without the README.

## Building and installing using DKMS

This tree supports Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS), a system for
generating kernel modules from out-of-tree kernel sources. It can be used to
install/uninstall kernel modules, and the module will be automatically rebuilt
from source when the kernel is upgraded (for example using your package manager).

1. Install DKMS and other required tools

    ```shell
    $ apt-get install git linux-headers-generic build-essential dkms
    ```

2. Add the driver to DKMS. This will copy the source to a system directory so
that it can used to rebuild the module on kernel upgrades.

    ```shell
    $ dkms add .
    ```

3. Build and install the driver.

    ```shell
    $ dkms install rtl8192eu/1.0
    ```

If you wish to uninstall the driver at a later point, use
_dkms uninstall rtl8192eu/1.0_. To completely remove the driver from DKMS use
_dkms remove rtl8192eu/1.0_.

## Submitting patches

1. Fork repo
2. Do your patch in a topic branch
3. Open a pull request on GH, or send it by email to `Magnus Bergmark <magnus.bergmark@gmail.com>`.
4. I'll squash your commits when everything checks out and add it to `master`.
